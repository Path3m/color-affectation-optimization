# color-affectation-optimization
Trying to implement a method to optimise color affectation between categories of data by taking into account the contrast need and color distance.  

This repository is the next of my previous work on js graph library [see](https://github.com/Path3m/test-js-steamgraph) and genetic optimisation [see](https://github.com/Path3m/test-optigen).
