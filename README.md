# Color-affectation-optimization
Trying to implement a method to optimise color affectation between categories of data by taking into account the contrast need and color distance.  

This repository is the next of my previous work on js graph library [see](https://github.com/Path3m/test-js-steamgraph) and genetic optimisation [see](https://github.com/Path3m/test-optigen).  
  
For the package information [click here](https://github.com/Path3m/color-affectation-optimization/tree/main/package-version/cid-cao), or go to the `package-version/cid-cao` directory.  

If you want to try some functionnalities of the package, you can download this repository, then start a local server (using pyhton or node for instance). Then, after opening the server file in a browser you can go in the `public` directory and navigate through the example html pages to discover what this package try to improve. **However**, even this intercative example is still under development.
